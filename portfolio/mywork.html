   <p id="projects">MSU's Migrant Student Services has a program called CAMP (College Assistant Migrant Program). The students
   in the program typically come from southern states and are of low income. I worked with the program's coordinator to discuss some 
   issues in order to develop a plan to address them effectively and efficiently. An issue I decided to focus on was their lack of winter 
   clothing. I designed a flyer to let them know what to wear and what not to wear, accompanied with an inexpensive location to get these items. I also teamed up with a couple other people
   focusing on the same issue and incorporated their work into my flyer so the students receive as much information as possible (ex. the Tumblr page link at the bottom).</p>
