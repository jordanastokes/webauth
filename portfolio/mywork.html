   <p id="projects">MSU's Migrant Student Services has a program called CAMP (College Assistant Migrant Program). The students
   in the program typically come from southern states and are of low income. I worked with the program's coordinator to discuss some 
   issues in order to develop a plan to address them effectively and efficiently. An issue I decided to focus on was their lack of winter 
   clothing. I designed a flyer the students to refer to that includes what to wear and what not to wear, accompanied with an 
   inexpensive location to get winter clothing items. I also teamed up with a couple other people focusing on the same issue and 
   incorporated their work into my flyer so the students receive as much information as possible (ex. the Tumblr page link at the bottom).</p>
